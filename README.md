# Py4Ev

 This is the repository for all the exercises made in the course Python for Everybody of the Professor Charles Severance, this was made directly from
the website of the course, so is not a paid version with a certificate eligible one, like from the Coursera or EDX platforms.
With this repositorie i'm demonstrating that i realize all the course and exercises of it and to prove that i adquired the knowledge of the material presented in the course.
It also validates my progress for the OSSU-CS certificate.
